Code starts with registration and login portal where the user needs to enter his credentials to login and register (username and password) login and registration credentials are case sensitive
After entering the credentials code asks the user to press any key to continue
Then out of some type of items user needs to enter any subsequence that he wants to consume in any case (for example if the user types BuTrCks then the computer lists him all words that contain the subsequence in this case BUTTER COOKIES will be displayed along with its price and a unique and ordered serial number)
The user now needs to select any serial number he needs to consume and then the quantity he needs to have (id user enters the wrong serial number again and again the program will ask him to enter the correct serial number again and again and so is the case with quantity if user have entered quantity out of stock computer will show the stocks available now user have to enter a value in that quantity)
the program then asks the user if he wants to have more (if yes program begins again from the input subsequence)
If the user type no program will show all items ordered by the user along with the quantity and their total price
After a thanks message program takes minor details from the user taking his name, address, pin, and phone number as input for delivery purposes 
The program then lists the order BILL (that includes name address pin phone and ordered items)
In the end, the program also takes small feedback from the user (The user needs to rate the bakery from 1 to 5 and if the user has entered <=2 program asks the user how can we improve our service)
